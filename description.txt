Pipette Tool (Pick Block) by Arguswastaken

This is a simple mod to make building faster and more convenient. Hover the mouse over a tile in the world and hit the keybind to select that block in your hotbar.

I thought about this idea while playing so I just made it and figured other people might want to use it too. Make sure to adjust the mod config to your preferences.

I have put this mod open source on GitHub. This is mostly for new modders to look at the code, but I guess you can submit an issue if you really want to.

A slightly more detailed explanation of how it works: if you have the item in your hotbar, you will switch to it automatically. Otherwise it will be pulled from your inventory. If you have space in your hotbar it will be moved there and you will switch to it, otherwise it will swap with the block you are currently holding. It should work with any modded tile. I recommend setting the keybind to the right mouse button.

Thanks to GasGrass for additional testing.
